# GHL API Coverage Report

Generated from official GHL docs commit: 192cd68

## Source Snapshot

- Official docs repo: https://github.com/GoHighLevel/highlevel-api-docs.git
- Docs checkout: `tmp/highlevel-api-docs`
- Docs commit: `192cd68b065a7423c543d82721eb8644cdc883c7`
- Docs tag/description: `192cd68`
- Official endpoint references parsed: 576
- Local endpoint references parsed: 833
- Local TypeScript files scanned: 59

## Coverage Summary

- Unique official endpoints: 576
- Unique local endpoints: 829
- Official endpoints with an exact method/path match locally: 576
- Exact-match coverage: 100%
- Likely missing official endpoints: 0
- Potential local-only/deprecated/private endpoints: 253

Exact matching is intentionally conservative. Dynamic path generation, aliases, and compatibility wrappers may create false positives, but this gives us a repeatable first-pass map.

## Changelog-Only Findings To Plan Around

- 2026-04-28 — Users: GET /users/ endpoint deprecated (https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Changelog/index.html)
- 2026-04-21 — Notes: Top-level Notes endpoints added: POST /notes/, POST /notes/search, DELETE /notes/{id}, GET /notes/{id}, PUT /notes/{id}, PATCH /notes/{id}/attachments, PUT /notes/{id}/relations, POST /notes/{id}/restore (https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Changelog/index.html)
- 2026-04-15 — Users/Scopes: New user scope enum values added for audit logs, location management, and payments settings (https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Changelog/index.html)
- Recent product changelog — Emails: Email Campaign V2 APIs introduced; future email campaign improvements focus on V2 endpoints (https://ideas.gohighlevel.com/changelog/new-improved-email-marketing-public-apis)

## High-Priority Missing Official Endpoints

- None found.

## Potential Local-Only High-Risk Endpoints

These deserve manual review because they may be legacy, private, renamed, or simply not matched by the scanner.

## Recommended Update Plan

1. Add a CI-friendly version of this scanner so API drift is visible after every docs refresh.
2. Make `GHL_API_VERSION` configurable in all server entry points and keep endpoint-specific overrides for APIs that still require older version headers.
3. Review `users-tools.ts` against the latest official users spec and retire or alias deprecated `GET /users/` behavior.
4. Keep the first-class top-level Notes module in place for the 2026-04-21 changelog endpoints, and reconcile it against the official spec once those endpoints land in the docs repo.
5. Upgrade `email-tools.ts` and `campaigns-tools.ts` toward the Email Campaign V2 endpoints under `/emails/*`; preserve old tool names as compatibility aliases where practical.
6. Update OAuth/private-integration scope documentation for new audit-log, location-management, and payment-settings scopes.
7. Manually inspect local-only campaign, workflow, OAuth, and trigger endpoints. If they are internal/private APIs, mark them clearly in tool descriptions and README so users know their stability profile.
8. Add targeted tests for each migrated module using the current official path, method, version header, and required query/body fields.
